## Livewire

- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version-specific documentation for how to write Livewire and Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` Artisan command to create new components.
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend; they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle Hook Examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>

## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire Component Test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Livewire Component Exists on Page" lang="php">
    $this->get('/posts/create')
    ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
</code-snippet>

=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 3, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire; don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="Livewire Init Hook Example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>
